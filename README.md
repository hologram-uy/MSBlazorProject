## How Copilot Assisted in Each Step of the Development Process

### **Activity 1: Initial Development and Component Creation**
- **Copilot Assistance:**  
  Copilot suggested structures for Blazor components like `EventCard.razor`, with fields such as event name, date, and location. It also provided code snippets to implement basic routing between pages (Event List, Event Details, Registration).
  
- **Benefit:**  
  Copilot accelerated the development process by providing ready-to-use structures for key components and best practices for navigation routing.

### **Activity 2: Debugging and Optimization**
- **Copilot Assistance:**  
  Copilot identified common errors like invalid input data binding and routing issues. It suggested input validation improvements and provided error handling mechanisms for invalid paths in the appâ€™s routing.
  
- **Benefit:**  
  Copilot helped fix critical bugs, such as handling invalid form data and improving performance with large datasets. It suggested optimizations like using the `Virtualize` component to manage large event lists more efficiently.

### **Activity 3: Advanced Features and Final Enhancements**
- **Copilot Assistance:**  
  Copilot generated code for the Registration Form with validation using `DataAnnotations` and `EditForm`. It also proposed a `UserSessionService` for managing user sessions and an `AttendanceList` for tracking event participation.
  
- **Benefit:**  
  Copilot provided guidance on handling advanced features, like user registration with proper validation, session management, and attendance tracking, ensuring the app would be ready for deployment.

### **Styling and User Interface Enhancements**
- **Copilot Assistance:**  
  Copilot suggested CSS base styles (using Bootstrap), and helped structure custom CSS for the EventEase app to enhance the visual appearance of all pages.

- **Benefit:**  
  Copilot streamlined the UI design process by suggesting efficient and aesthetically pleasing styles for the application, improving the user experience.
